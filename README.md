# Maze Solver 

Welcome to the Maze Solver application, a project aimed at building a 2D grid maze solver using the Java programming language. The application allows users to find the shortest possible path between a starting and ending point within a maze. The project will include a live demo showcasing its functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **User Interface Library**: Java Swing

## IDE

This project is developed using Apache NetBeans, a powerful integrated development environment for Java. The use of NetBeans simplifies the development process and provides a robust environment for building Java applications.

## Project Overview

The Maze Solver grid consists of various colored blocks representing different elements of the maze:

- **Black Blocks**: Represent obstacles, making it impossible for the path to pass through.
- **White Blocks**: These are the accessible blocks through which the path can travel.
- **Green Blocks**: These represent the path traveled.

The primary goal of the project is to implement a business logic algorithm capable of finding the shortest path between the specified starting and ending points within the maze.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Run the project to launch the Maze Solver application.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or report issues. Let's build this Maze Solver together, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience!

Happy maze-solving! üåê
